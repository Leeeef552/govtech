## Price categories:
- dependent on flat types:
    - 1-5 Room (1 room cheapest)
    - Executive
    - Multigeneration (most expensive)


## Data date range:
- BTO date range:  Apr 2008 to Mar 2023
- Resale date range: 2000 to Aug 2025


## Notes
- only 1 dataset available on data.gov.sg has BTO price data but lacks floor info
- use resale prices as a proxy?
- resale prices:
    - Before 2012: HDB resale statistics were published by approval date.
    - After 2012: They switched to registration date for standardisation, transparency, and legal consistency.
    - Registration date is less ambiguous → once registered, the transaction is formally binding.
    - Approval date can precede registration by weeks, which could create misalignment.
  
- not entirely sure what the AHG/SHG mean, it would affect the actual price due to grants 
    - “Selling Price less AHG/SHG” means the discounted price of the flat after subtracting government housing grants, assuming the buyer meets eligibility criteria. It gives a more realistic sense of what first-time households actually paid, rather than the headline selling price.



## Notes:
- When HDB launches a BTO project, they don’t publish the exact price of each individual unit. Instead, they give a range:
e.g., 4-room in Yishun: $280,000 – $340,000.
- This range reflects expected differences in floor level, facing, layout, and location within the project, but:
- Buyers only see the range before balloting.
- After you ballot successfully and select your flat, you’ll know your unit’s exact price — but HDB doesn’t release all those unit-level details publicly.
- So in datasets: ✅ you only see min & max prices by room type, town, and year, not flat-by-flat breakdowns.

- Resale data is very different from BTO data because it is transaction-level, based on actual sales between buyer and seller. For each resale flat sold, HDB records and publishes detailed attributes such as the town and block or street, flat type (e.g., 3R, 4R, 5R), floor level range (e.g., “10–12”), floor area in square meters, remaining lease, and the exact resale price transacted.

- How BTO Flats are Priced
First, HDB establishes the market value of the flat by looking at the prices of comparable resale flats nearby, which is influenced by prevailing market conditions, as well as the individual attributes of the flats. Some factors that impact the market value of a new flat include:
    - Project location
    - Projects with locational advantages will have higher prices:
        * Proximity to city or town centre
        * Accessibility to key transport nodes
        * Accessibility to key amenities, such as supermarkets, food centres or malls
        * Flat attributes
    - Flats with more attractive attributes will cost more:
    - Larger flat sizes
    - Higher storey heights
    - More ideal orientation with desirable views
    - Prevailing market conditions	Market values of BTO flats across different time periods will differ as we also consider the prevailing market conditions at the time of sale.
